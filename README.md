# Sanctuary Helpers

This site was a client PSD conversion example to demonstrate CSS/Sass abilities and semantic HTML. I followed the PSD closely using the provided style guide and images.

## Tools/Methods used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Sass
- Style guide
- Responsive design
- Multi-page 
- Accessibility best practices

## Tasks:
- Convert a PSD image to a live multipage site
- Connect the nav links to each page
- Utilize Sass CSS pre-processor
- Ensure responsiveness down to 320px
- Write semantic accessible code

## Challenges/Improvements:
- This went quite smoothly once I understood the powers of object-fit and object-position properties enabling me to arrange image elements the same way I would manipulate a background image in CSS.
